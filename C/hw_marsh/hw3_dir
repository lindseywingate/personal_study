HW-3	CS230	10 points	Due: 2/3/2017

Malloc the Barbarian and Calloc, his faithful wife, 
are heroes in Tatooinian folklore. You will honor 
their memory with this assignment.

Write a C program  (no system commands allowed) to 
numerically merge the three integer list files 
(list0.txt, list1.txt, and list2.txt). The output 
must be a file called hw3.out and the output must 
be numerically sorted.

Your code must use malloc/calloc to create dynamically 
allocated arrays to hold the data. Also, you MUST call 
free() as appropriate.

Note that you CANNOT cheat by using Linux commands to 
do this. It must be done entirely in your C code.

Note that the size of the files will NOT be the same 
as those on my website. They may be larger or smaller.

Hint:
Foghorn Leghorn: I need, I say, I need a pointer, and 
that dog's got just the head for it. Pointed, that is. 

More Hints:
1. Assume integers.
2. Determine file sizes first (they may be different).
3. Create a single dynamic array to hold all of the numbers.
4. Sort the numbers.
5. Write result to hw3.out.
6. man 3 malloc or calloc.
7. man 3 feof.
