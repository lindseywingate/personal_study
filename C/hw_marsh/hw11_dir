HW-11	CS230		40 points	Due: April 24

On this day in 1184 BC The Greeks entered Troy using 
the Trojan Horse. Which has nothing to do with computer 
science.


For this assignment you will divide up HW-10 and develop a
Makefile to practice using the compiler and linker with
libraries. All files will be strictly C code - no C++!

Part 1 (10 points):
------------------
Seperate HW-10 into the following 4 files:

1) One file will contain all of the code/functions that 
   build the doubly-linked linked list. 
   Call it hw11-yourname-A.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw11-yourname-A.h

2) One file will contain all of the code/functions that 
   build the garbage linked list. 
   Call it hw11-yourname-B.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw11-yourname-B.h

3) One file will contain all of the code/functions that 
   display the linked lists. 
   Call it hw11-yourname-C.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw11-yourname-C.h

4) One file will contain all of the code/functions that 
   free the linked lists. 
   Call it hw11-yourname-D.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw11-yourname-D.h

Write a Makefile that compiles and links the above in 2 (two) 
steps. You MUST call this Makefile "Makefile1".

Part 2 (5 points):
------------------
Write a Makefile that creates a STATIC library/archive 
(hw11-lib-yourname.a) out of the associated *.c files (1, 2, 
3, & 4) and that compiles and links hw11-yourname-main.c 
with your static library. You MUST call this Makefile "Makefile2".


Part 3 (5 points):
------------------
Write a Makefile that creates SHARED a library 
(hw11-lib-yourname.so) out of the associated c files (1, 2, 
3, & 4) and that compiles and links hw11-yourname-main.c 
with your shared library. You MUST call this Makefile "Makefile3".


Part 4 (20 points):
-------------------
Modify hw11-yourname-main.c to use the SHARED library 
(hw11-lib-yourname.so) dynamically (using dlopen). Call 
this MAIN program hw11-yourname-4.c

Write a Makefile that compiles and links hw11-yourname-4.c
with your dynamic shared library. You MUST call this 
Makefile "Makefile4".

Note that all of the functionallity must exist in this program
as it did in hw10 to earn full credit.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of each file
   of your program.

3. Your tarball must be named hw11-yourname.tar

4. Email your source (subject hw11-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
