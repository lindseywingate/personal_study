S230	10 points	Due: March 24

Write a program that builds a doubly linked linked-list and 
populate the linked list with the integers 0 through N.
 
Note that you must trap cases where you have no command line 
arguments and where you have too many command line arguments. 
It is OK in both of these cases to print an error message and 
exit the program.

Your program must display the value of N (formatted as shown
 below - tab seperated) followed by a blank line. You may 
also want to "man 3 atoi()".

As you populate the list, print out the values being inserted 
(formatted as shown below - tab seperated), followed by a 
blank line.

Once the list is populated, print out the contents from left 
to right, then print out a blank line, then print out the 
contents from right to left.

The inputs (data or payload) will simply come from a for loop 
(0 to N), in that order! Here is what your output MUST look 
like (except N will vary).

Command line argument:	3

Input data:		0
Input data:		1
Input data:		2
Input data:		3

Left to right output:	0
Left to right output:	1
Left to right output:	2
Left to right output:	3

Right to left output:	3
Right to left output:	2
Right to left output:	1
Right to left output:	0

Finally, pictorally, the linked list should look like this:

Head -> |---| -> |---| -> NULL
        | 0 |    | 1 |
NULL <- |___| <- |___| <- Tail

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw8-yourname.c

4. Email your source (subject hw8-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
