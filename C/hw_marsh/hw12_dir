HW-12	CS230	10 points	Due: Monday, May 1

May Day (May 1) is a public holiday and an ancient 
northern hemisphere spring festival. It is also a 
traditional spring holiday in many cultures. Dances, 
singing, and cake are usually part of the celebrations 
that the day includes. In the case of computer science, 
it also celebrates the last homework assignment. 

Tweak your HW10 code to extract every bit of performance 
possible. At minimum, you need to generate and Excel plot
(a line chart) that shows runtime vs optimization tried 
(vertical axis should be runtime, horizontal axis should 
be optimization tried). Your chart needs to have at least 
5 different optimizations with 1 baseline (6 in total). 

Your worst runtime needs to be around 30 seconds, so you 
will probably have to wrap your code in a for-loop to 
get it to run long enough. I suggest you pick a seed 
for the random number generator too.

To measure the runtime, you will need to add a time 
counter (clock) to your code (see class website).
