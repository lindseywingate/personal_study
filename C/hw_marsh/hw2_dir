HW-2	CS230	10 points	Due: 1/27/2017

Write a program to alphabetically merge the three word list files 
(american0.txt, american1.txt, and american2.txt). The output must 
be a file called words.txt and the output must be alphabetically 
sorted.

Note that you CAN cheat by using Linux commands to do this. However,
a single C program must implement your process regardless.

"man 3 system" and "man cat" - As Foghorn Leghorn might say "That's a hint son."
