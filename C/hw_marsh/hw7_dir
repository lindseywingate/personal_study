Write a program that uses a pointer-based linked
list. You should use the following struct (declared
as a global):

   struct node {
      char name[42];
      struct node *next;
   };

Note that no other variables can be global.

To populate your linked list open the hw7.data file and 
read in the contents. The file format is as follows: 
name op_code
  For example:
  Vlad a
  Cullen a
  Morticia a
  Ophelia a
  Smurf a
  Morticia d

The name will be a string. The op_code will be a character 
('a' or 'd'), where 'a' indicates that you should add this 
person to the linked-list, 'd' indicates that you should 
delete this person from the linked-list. Note that when
you add a person you must add them in increasing order. I.e.
we are adding them as an insertion sort (no, you cannot presort
the list). This MUST be seperate functions (adding and deleting).

You also need to provide output that proves your program works. 
After the last data item has been processed, your program must 
display the contents of the linked-list. This MUST be a seperate 
function.

Your program must also correctly free all links of the list 
on termination. This MUST be a seperate function.

EXTRA CREDIT (10 points):
-------------------------

Instead of creating a single link linked-list, create a doubly 
linked linked list. Populate the list accordingly and display 
the contents of the list from both directions (you must clearly
state which display is which). Also note in your email, that you 
did the extra credit. 

The extra credit grading is atomic - it either works (+10 points) 
or it doesn't (0 points).

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw7-yourname.c

4. Email your source (subject hw7-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
